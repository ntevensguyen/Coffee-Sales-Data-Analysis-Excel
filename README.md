# Coffee Sales Data Analysis Excel Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Coffee Sales Dashboard provides an interactive visualization of coffee sales data, enabling users to explore trends, customer behavior, and geographic distribution across different coffee types. The dashboard is built using a dataset containing sales information, coffee varieties, customer data, and geographic insights. It allows users to analyze the impact of factors like coffee variety, roast type, and customer loyalty on sales performance.

## Features

The dashboard offers a time series analysis of coffee sales trends, displaying line charts for four coffee varieties—Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta—across multiple years. It includes filtering options for roast type (Dark, Light, Medium), package size (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg), and loyalty program participation. These filters allow users to drill down into the data and uncover insights related to specific product categories or customer segments.

## Key Visualizations

The dashboard presents key visualizations such as:
- **Total Sales Over Time**: A multi-line chart tracking sales in USD for different coffee varieties.
- **Top Paying Customers**: A bar chart displaying the highest spending customers.
- **Sales By Country**: A map showing sales distribution, highlighting major markets like the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

## Data Structure

The dataset includes information such as order dates, coffee types, roast levels, customer details, sales amounts, and geographic data. These variables allow for dynamic filtering and segmentation to reveal insights across different metrics.

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard is built with interactive elements and a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. It uses real-time filtering, where changes to one visualization automatically update others, allowing users to explore the data in an intuitive way.

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals significant insights, such as the dominance of the U.S. market, top-paying customers like Allis Wilmore, and distinct seasonal trends in coffee sales. Users can compare performance across coffee varieties and investigate customer preferences by applying various filters.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates could include more granular geographic data, predictive sales forecasting, inventory tracking, and the ability to export reports. Adding more customer demographic information could also provide deeper insights.
